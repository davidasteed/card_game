Card Game

developer:  David Steed

General Description:  Create a card game: the game of War. In this game, two players compete against each other. They are each dealt 26 cards (half of a full deck) and they play the cards one at a time. The person with the higher card (Ace being the highest) wins that hand. For this version of the game, we will allow ties to happen, and we will not reshuffle the player's decks. As such, the game is over once all of the cards have been played, and the winner is whomever won the most hands.
